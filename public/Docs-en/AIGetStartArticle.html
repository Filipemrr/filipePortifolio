    <h1>How to Easily Integrate AI in your Backend</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <h2>Tutorial Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This tutorial will teach you how to integrate your system with AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        First things first, it's worth knowing that there are several ways
        to integrate your application with AI, including the Gemini API, OPEN AI API, and others.
        However, I highly recommend using the OPEN AI API because it has the best LLM on the market.
        In this tutorial, I will use Open AI's one, fell free to choose.
        Although the costs are slightly higher than those of Gemini and others, evaluate the best option for you and get to work.

    <h2>What is a Token?</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this article, you will encounter the term 'Token', so it's crucial to understand what it means.
        Essentially, a token represents the way we quantify our calls to the API;
        for example, one request may cost 'x' tokens, and 'y' tokens might cost 0.50 dollars (depending on the model you are using),
        with one token approximately equating to four characters in the English language.
    </p>
    <p>
        The token concept involves more detailed ideas to understand how tokens are measured
        in characters.
        However, knowing the basics is enough to manage the costs of using the API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each request will consume three different quantities of tokens: your prompt, the rules of your prompt, and the AI response.
        Summing these provides the total token cost of the request. Additionally, the total cost of each request can be determined;
        the API response provides this value along with other information.
    </p>
    <p>
        OpenAI has a very intuitive tool to measure tokens, called the 'Tokenizer', available at this link:
        <a
                href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"

        <img src="/AITutorialImages/token_Example.png" alt="example image">
    </fieldset>
    <p>
        The cost per 1 million tokens for the model 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125' is significantly lower than that of GPT-4, and it served me very well.
        According to the OpenAI documentation (april, 2024), the costs per 1 million  tokens are:
    <ul>
        <li>gpt-3.5-turbo-0125: 0.50 dollars</li>
        <li>GPT-4: 10 dollars</li>
    </ul>

            <h3>Route Declaration (controller.ts)</h3>
        <p>
            Set your API key as an environment variable; personally, I use a .env file
            filled with all my API keys and database passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: I'm using the MVC architecture, so I call the service in my controller. Controllers
            declare routes, receive, and return data. Services do the work properly.

                            This is a crucial part of the call because if you want to ask a highly specific
                            question that returns JSON or specific data for your API, you need to define your
                            prompt accurately. Applying our knowledge of prompt engineering is essential to obtain the best responses
                            and ensure the system performs as needed. The real value lies here.

                            it defines how the user will interact with the system.

                            <code>messages:</code> The 'system' role tells the API the type of role, defining the AI's behavior for your request.
                            You can specify aspects like the response language, personality, format, and how to treat the user.
                            Conversely, the 'user' role indicates the user's interaction, such as a question or data to process,
                            essentially what the user needs at the moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>max_tokens:</code> Limits the output length by specifying how many tokens the response should contain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>temperature:</code> Controls the randomness of the output. A lower temperature results in more
                            deterministic and consistent responses, while a higher temperature allows for more creativity and variety
                            in the responses. The choice depends on the type of task you have; per example, you need to summarize a transcript ?
                            use a low temperature, as the AI does not need to create anything new, just summarize the existing content.

                        <p>
                            <code>model:</code> Specifies the particular AI model to use. You can check the available models,
                            which include more than just GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. Remember to check the cost per 1 million tokens;
                            unless you need to perform a really complex or specific task, I highly recommend using GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4, as the cost of GPT-4 is literally 20 times that of GPT-3.5.

            <p>QUESTION: 'Why did the United States join World War 2?'</p>
            <p>Response: 'Ah, a great question! The United States entered World War II for several reasons. One of
                the main catalysts was the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941. This attack
                resulted in the death of over 2,400 Americans and the destruction of much of the U.S.
                Pacific Fleet.\n\nAdditionally, the United States had been providing significant aid to the Allied powers,
                particularly Great Britain and the Soviet Union, through programs like Lend-Lease.
                As the war progressed and Nazi Germany expanded its control in Europe, there was a
                growing realization that the Axis powers posed a serious threat to global peace and stability.
                \n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt and many Americans believed that the country had a moral
                obligation to stand up against the aggression and tyranny of the Axis powers. The attack on Pearl
                Harbor solidified public opinion in favor of entering the war, and the United States officially
                declared war on Japan the day after the attack.\n\nUltimately, the United States joined World War
                II to defend democracy, protect its national interests, and support its allies in the fight against
                fascism and tyranny.'</p>
