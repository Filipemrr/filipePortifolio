<h1>More Efficient Progress Bar for Advertisements</h1>

<p>A simple project, but one that highlights the importance of mathematics in programming, combining mathematics, marketing, and of course, programming.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To create the effect that the progress bar is moving faster than normal at the beginning (giving a false impression to the viewer that the video is short) and slower as it approaches the end.</li>
    <li>This effect significantly increases the "watch time" of the video; this small feature can increase the conversion rate and profit margin of the page if the video being displayed is a sales video.</li>
    <li>To demonstrate the importance of mathematics as an indispensable tool for programmers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Logic of Traditional Progression</h2>
<p>We know that a traditional progression bar (like the red one on YouTube) is given by the ratio (P = Progression, all in seconds):</p>
<pre>P = Current moment / total video duration</pre>
<p>Note that the value of P will always be between 0.0 and 1.0, as the "Current moment" will always be less than the total duration, but always greater than 0.</p>
<p>The value of the "Current moment" is updated every millisecond. Therefore, the variable P is constantly updated, creating the sensation of continuous growth, similar to a loading bar.</p>
<pre>
P/ Current Moment = 0  | P = 0 , so the video has not yet started
P/ Current Moment = 15 | P = 0.25, so 25% of the video has passed
P/ Current Moment = 30 | P = 0.5, so 50% of the video has passed
P/ Current Moment = 60 | P = 1, so the video has ended
</pre>

<h2>Mathematical Logic Behind the Problem</h2>
<p>We need to think about the calculations in terms of P, as this is the value that will be updated all the time, remembering that 0 < P < 1.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My function will define the speed at which P grows.</li>
    <li>But for our bar to work, the function needs to respect the following rules:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
When P = 0, f(p) = 0
When P = 1, f(p) = 1
The curve's inclination needs to start more steeply and end more gently
</pre>
<p>I thought about using a quadratic function, you can also use an exponential function, but I think it's much easier to use a quadratic function in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Creating the Player</h2>
<p>In the code snippet below, I simply take the player div and set up the page to display the video. For more details, consult the documentation of React Player, which was the library I used in this project.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;div className="playerWrapper"&gt;
    &lt;ReactPlayer
        playing
        onDuration={(d) =&gt; setDuration(d)}
        progressInterval={100}
        onProgress={(p) =&gt; {
            setPlayed(p.playedSeconds);
            setLoaded(p.loadedSeconds);
        }}
        config={{
            youtube: {
                playerVars: { showinfo: 1 },
            },
        }}
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLslsZuEaNE"
        controls={true} // Add this line to display controls, including the volume bar
    /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Inserting the Modified Progress Bar</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the progress bar can be made by dividing the current moment of the video by the total duration of the same. I am calling a function that will be explained below and passing a number between 0 and 1 that represents how much of the video has been consumed. This function is called thousands of times in a single minute, creating the effect of a progressing bar.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;ProgressBar progress={barra_de_progressao(played / duration)}&gt;
    &lt;div /&gt;
&lt;/ProgressBar&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>The Function</h2>
<p>The function is given by</p>
<pre><code>
function barra_de_progressao(x) {
  return -(x * x) + (2 * x);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's amazing how this problem can be complex enough to require knowledge in different areas to be solved.
    Yet, its application is based on a function of just one line.</p>
<p>
    Basically, if you define the value of P to behave the equation -(x * x) + (2 * x); in other words,
    ProgressBarPercentage = - (currentMoment * currentMoment) + (2 * currentMoment);
    As I already Explained, the 'ProgressBar' will always be between a value 0 and 1, such that this value
     represents the size of progress bar.
<p>
For 'currentValues' between 0 and 1, the P value will grow as the curve inside the red square.

<h3>Progress Bar Value (P) will be always:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Between 0 and 1
    </li>
    <li>
        The growing of P will be faster at the beginning and slightly become slower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Must work with any video duration because it behaves as a linear function.
    </li>
</ul>
